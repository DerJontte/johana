## Johana Framework for PHP 
A microframework inspired by Kohana

I started this project for two main reasons: Firstly, I needed an MVC-framework with an extensive ORM, but one that was significantly smaller than the existing ones, and secondly (but perhaps more importantly), I wanted to brush up my PHP skills that were - to put it mildly - somewhat rusty and outdated.

Since the project is still in a very early stage of construction, there is no documentation whatsoever. Also, the code is littered with debugging stuff (I know, bad practice!)
